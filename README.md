# ML_models
This is a repository of my machine learning projects in R
The projects in this repository are machine learning models and also R programmed projects made by me as I go through this journey.
The projects can be used as both refrences and learning guidiance.
I have tried my best to simplify the process for aspiring ML engineers,stakeholder, recruiters and also those who just want to see how ML models look like.
This repository gives me a checker for the work I do and also my growth as a data analyst, data scientist and a Machine learning engineer.
